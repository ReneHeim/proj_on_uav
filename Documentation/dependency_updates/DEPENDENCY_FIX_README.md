# Dependency Update Fix - September 1, 2025

## Issue Description
The weekly dependency update was failing due to network timeout issues during CI/CD pipeline execution. The problem was identified as PyPI connectivity issues causing pip installations to timeout.

## Root Cause
- Network timeouts when connecting to PyPI (pypi.org) during dependency installation
- Large development dependency files causing extended installation times
- CI environment network connectivity limitations

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced CI Reliability
- Added pip timeout and retry configurations
- Split dependency installation into essential vs optional packages
- Added continue-on-error for non-critical installations

### 2. Dependency File Restructuring
- `requirements-dev.txt`: Minimal essential dependencies for CI
- `requirements-dev-full.txt`: Complete development dependencies for local use
- Pinned exact versions for better reliability

### 3. Robust Installation Script
- Created `scripts/install_deps.sh` with retry logic
- Configurable timeouts and retry attempts
- Graceful handling of optional dependency failures

## Files Modified

### CI Workflows
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`: Enhanced with timeout handling and retry logic
- `.github/workflows/dependencies.yml`: Added pip configuration for reliability

### Dependency Files
- `requirements-dev.txt`: Minimized for CI reliability (essential tools only)
- `requirements-dev-full.txt`: Full development environment (local use)
- `pip.conf`: Pip configuration with timeout and retry settings

### New Files
- `scripts/install_deps.sh`: Robust dependency installer with retry logic
- `DEPENDENCY_FIX_README.md`: This documentation

## Usage

### For CI/CD
The workflows now automatically use the enhanced installation process with timeouts and retries.

### For Local Development

#### Essential development setup:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

#### Full development setup:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev-full.txt
```

#### Using the robust installer:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/install_deps.sh
./scripts/install_deps.sh
```

## Testing
- ✅ Core dependencies install successfully
- ✅ Essential test tools work
- ✅ Main application functionality verified
- ✅ CI workflow resilience improved

## Future Recommendations
1. Monitor CI success rates to ensure timeouts are resolved
2. Consider using dependency caching in CI workflows
3. Periodically review and update timeout values based on CI performance
4. Consider using alternative package indices if PyPI reliability continues to be an issue
